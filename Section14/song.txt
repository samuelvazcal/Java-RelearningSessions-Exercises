Perfect Symmetry by Keane

I shake through the wreckage for signs of life
Scrolling through the paragraphs
Clicking through the photographs
I wish I could make sense of what we do
Burning down the capitals
The wisest of the animals
Who are you?
What are you living for?
Tooth for tooth
Maybe we'll go one more
This life is lived in perfect symmetry
What I do, that will be done to me
Read page after page of analysis
Looking for the final score
We're no closer than we were before
Who are you?
What are you fighting for?
Holy truth
Brother I choose this mortal
Life lived in perfect symmetry
What I do, that will be done to me
As the needle, slips into the run out groove
Love, maybe you feel it too
And maybe you'll find, life is unkind
And over so soon
There is no golden gate
There's no heavenâ€¦
