Don't turn your back on me
Conceal and protect me
I need you to stop me from reeling around
The time's gonna come when
You no longer need me
But stay by my side til the sun has gone down
When I am an old man and live by the sea
Will all your thoughts fly to me?
As much as I want to
I can't hold onto you
When will you return to your old home again
May love lie around you
Good fortune surround you
You know where to turn to when you need a friend
When I am an old man and live by the sea
Will all your thoughts fly to me
When I'm far away...

Fly To Me by Keane
